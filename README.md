# GoBuildSomething

GoBuildSomething is a minimal CLI tool built with Go that helps you to quickly scaffold a new project.

Simply provide a project name and optional path (defaults to Desktop) to get started with an already initialized Git repository

**Why?**

I just wanted to automate the process of creating new projects, I got tired of doing mkdir, cd and git init multiple times everyday ðŸ¥²

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed on your system.
- A project idea ðŸ§ 

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository

2. Run the program:

  ```
  cd GoBuildSomething && go run main.go
  ```

  or

  ```
  go build && go install
  GoBuildSomething
  ```

### **Help**

To get help on how to use the program, run:

```
go run main.go --help
```

or

```
GoBuildSomething -h
```
